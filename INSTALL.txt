LLDB Installation Instructions
==============================

LLDB builds on Mac OS X (with Xcode) and Linux (with GCC or Clang).

On Mac OS X, in addition to using Xcode you'll need to enable code signing
on your system to either build lldb or debug using lldb.  Please see the code
signing documentation in docs/code-signing.txt for more detailed directions.

If you are building on Mac OS X and LLVM is not present in llvm/, then LLDB
will check it out automatically.  The files in scripts/Xcode/repos determine
which branches of LLVM/Clang are checked out, depending on the current
LLDB branch, according to the algorithm in scripts/Xcode/repo.py.

For instructions to build LLDB on Linux, or more details about supported
compiler versions, other dependencies, and build flags, see:

## Build fix for Xcode with mulle_lldb_40

The script will try to download and bail on `release_40` not being there

Fix it like so:

```
cd llvm
git fetch origin refs/heads/release_40
git checkout -b release_40 f3d3277bb713bb8aced9a7ac2e9b05c52d2844ee

cd tools/clang
git fetch origin refs/heads/release_40
git checkout -b release_40 21fe7e8f8ab44b67238af7bf9ba9d8afdf0c0e2c
```
